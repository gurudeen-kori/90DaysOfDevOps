My 90-Day DevOps & Cloud Engineering Learning Plan
1. My Understanding of DevOps & Cloud Engineering
DevOps is not just tools or automation — it is a culture and mindset that connects software development and IT operations to deliver software faster, more reliably, and at scale.
DevOps focuses on:
•	Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)
•	Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
•	Monitoring, reliability, and automation
•	Collaboration between development and operations teams
Cloud Engineering complements DevOps by providing on-demand, scalable infrastructure using platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP. Instead of managing physical servers, cloud engineers design, deploy, secure, and optimize systems in the cloud

2. Why I Am Starting DevOps & Cloud Learning
I am learning DevOps & Cloud Engineering because:
•	The industry demand is high and growing globally
•	DevOps engineers work on real production systems, not just theory
•	It offers strong career growth, flexibility, and remote opportunities
•	I want to understand how software actually runs in the real world
•	I want a role where I can combine:
o	Problem-solving
o	Automation
o	Systems thinking
My goal is to move beyond basic development or IT knowledge and become someone who can design, deploy, automate, and maintain scalable systems
